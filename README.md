# apple-fonts

This repository contains official fonts from [Apple's design resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#fonts), made easily accessible for users that are designing on something other than a Mac.

If you want to find these fonts for yourself, here's a quick little tutorial:

1. Download a font from [Apple's design resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#fonts).
2. In a tool like 7-Zip, open the `.dmg` file.
3. Open the folder contained in the `.dmg` file.
4. Open the `.pkg` file inside that folder.
5. Open `Payload~`, it may take a second to copy.
6. NAvigate through a few folders: `.` > `Library` > `Fonts`
7. Select all the font files and extract them.

**I can't find a way to get symbols from SF Symbols.** If you do, please feel free to fork the repository and open a pull request!
